                    <h1>IRON MAN</h1>
                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.</p>

                    <h1>Thor</h1>
                    <p>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, superhero, self-proclaimed protector of Earth and the king of Asgard. Thor made a name for himself as the mightiest warrior on his homeworld and subsequently became well known for his actions on Earth, which included acting as a founding member of the Avengers. He is the son of the late Odin Borson and the late Frigga, and the adopted brother of the late Loki Laufeyson.</p> 
                    <p>Thor wielded the mystical war hammer Mjölnir, which channeled his God of Thunder abilities until it was destroyed by his sister Hela. In an attempt to flee his sister, Thor found himself stranded on Sakaar where he was forced to be a champion in the Grandmaster's games. After escaping Sakaar, he brought about Ragnarök with the help of the Revengers and destroyed his home and Hela with it. He lead the Asgardian refugees away from the destruction in hunt for a new home.</p>
                    <p>Thanos intercepted their vessel and killed a large amount of the refugees along with Loki, Thor survived the carnage and was found drifting in space by the Guardians of the Galaxy. Bent on getting revenge on Thanos, Thor went with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir so that Eitri could forge him a weapon powerful enough to kill Thanos and then returned to Earth to join the battle. Thanos was successful in his mission and decimated half of existence.</p>
                    <p>Thor was devastated and outraged by what Thanos had done and, upon finding out that the Mad Titan had destroyed the Infinity Stones, decapitated him as he no longer had any use. Over the next five years, Thor sunk into a depression, he settled the surviving refugees in New Asgard and ruled as their king but became a recluse, overweight drunk who the Asgardians barely saw.</p>

                    <h1>HULK</h1>
                    <p>Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers. As someone who was highly respected for his work regarding biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation, he was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum which created Captain America, although Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. However, when an exposure to high levels of gamma radiation instead of vita radiation went awry, the mild-mannered scientist had found that when angered, provoked or excited, he would transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly mindless creature known as Hulk.</p>

                       Peter Benjamin Parker is a high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the alter ego Spider-Man, hoping someday, he will live up to his heroes in the Avengers. While Parker juggled all his continued superhero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker then agreed and was given his new suit as well as brand new Stark technology in exchange for all his help, although Stark still did not make him an official member of the Avengers and instead returned Parker back home to continue his own hero work.

                       Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers,  and Earth's first superhero. Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from the service within United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Determined to serve, Rogers ultimately volunteered for the Project Rebirth, which enhanced the frail Rogers' body. Mistrusted by Chester Phillips, the head of the SSR, Rogers was relegated to propaganda campaigns, and was given the new moniker of Captain America.
